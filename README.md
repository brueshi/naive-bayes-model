Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem. It assumes that the features are independent of each other, which simplifies the modeling process.

Explanation:

We import the GaussianNB class from the sklearn.naive_bayes module.
An instance of the GaussianNB class is created.
The classifier is trained on the training data using the fit method.
Finally, we make predictions on the test data using the predict method and store the predicted values in y_pred.
